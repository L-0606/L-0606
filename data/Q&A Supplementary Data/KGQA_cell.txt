Round or oval shape, high malignant potential, aggressive growth rate, and presence of invagination or infiltration of surrounding tissue.
The differences in the cytologic manifestations of different subtypes of osteosarcoma are as follows:- Malignant fibrous histocytoma: Fibroblast-like cells with scanty intercellular connections and vesicular or papular lesions.\n- Osteosarcoma: Osteoblast-like cells with well-circumscribed margins and centralized nuclei, often showing necrosis and cartilage formation.\n- Chondrosarcoma: Chondroblast-like cells with prominent cell nuclear and cell质内 inclusion bodies and well-defined borders.
Superficial osteosarcoma has a higher degree of differentiation than classic central osteosarcoma, which means that the cells in superficial osteosarcoma are more closely aligned with normal bone tissue. Superficial osteosarcoma is generally considered to be a less aggressive subtype of osteosarcoma, with a lower risk of recurrence than classic central osteosarcoma. However, both subtypes can be highly malignant and have a high risk of recurrence.
The immune cells involved in the anti-tumor immune response in the microenvironment of osteosarcoma are likely to be T cells, natural killer cells, and bone marrow stromal cells.
There are several immunosuppressive cells in the microenvironment of osteosarcoma that are involved in tumor immune escape, including Treg cells, B cells, and dendritic cells.
Osteosarcoma cells release exosomes to evade immune detection.
Osteosarcoma cells use tumor-associated fibroblasts (CAF) to produce immunosuppressive cytokines and chemokines, which in turn inhibit the activation and function of immune cells, contributing to the development of an immunosuppressive microenvironment in osteosarcoma.
The relationship between osteosarcoma cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) involves the activation of macrophages, which in turn activates other immune cells to enhance the immune response against cancer.
Osteoblast cells, chondrocytes, and pericytes are the cells in the bone microenvironment that are involved in promoting osteosarcoma metastasis.
MSCs promote osteosarcoma metastasis by secreting factors and releasing exosomes through multiple mechanisms including cytokines, chemokines, and integrins.
The acidic and hypotoxic environments of bone microenvironment play a significant role in the metastasis of osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma cells thrive in these environments, leading to increased migration and spread of the disease. Further research is necessary to fully understand the relationship between the bone microenvironment and osteosarcoma metastasis.
Chemokines in the bone microenvironment play a critical role in the metastatic process of osteosarcoma by promoting the migration of cancer cells to the bone marrow and increasing their ability to evade detection by the immune system.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a crucial role in the bone microenvironment in osteosarcoma metastasis by promoting metastasis, providing nutrients and energy for cancer cells, and secreting proteins that contribute to the formation of a supportive microenvironment for cancer cells.
The cellular origin of osteosarcoma is sarcomatous cells, which are found in both soft tissues and bone. Osteosarcoma is a type of cancer that affects these cells.
The cells in the bone microenvironment that are involved in regulating the progression of osteosarcoma are osteoclasts and immune cells, such as T cells and B cells. Additionally, the presence of certain genes and signaling pathways, such as theKit signaling pathway, can also contribute to the progression of osteosarcoma.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a crucial role in the progression of cancer, including osteosarcoma. They can carry genetic material and contribute to the migration and spread of cancer cells. Further research is needed to understand the specific mechanisms by which EVs promote osteosarcoma growth and progression.
The therapeutic strategies to target osteosarcoma cell surface antigens are not well understood.
Round or oval shape, multiple mitochondria, high level of condensation, and scaffold-like structure.
Osteosarcoma cells have high rates of proliferation and differentiate into bone or cartilage tissue. Bone matrix production is associated with increased cell density and altered gene expression patterns. Cartilage matrix production is characterized by the expression of chondrogenic genes and the production of extracellular matrix components.
The reasons for the morphological heterogeneity of osteosarcoma among different subtypes include the presence of different cell types and structures within the tumor, which can lead to variations in function and behavior. This can contribute to unique clinical behaviors and treatment outcomes, and understanding these factors could help identify potential targets for new therapies.
The role of SATB2 in the diagnosis of osteosarcoma is to code for a protein that regulates the expression of other genes and may play a role in the development and progression of osteosarcoma. Studies have shown that alterations in the SATB2 gene can lead to the formation of osteosarcoma cells, making it a useful diagnostic marker for osteosarcoma.
Fiber morphology characterized by type of osteosarcoma cells longer and thinner than normal cells, with a high degree of cellular atypia and tends to be more malignant.  The morphological characteristics of sarcomatoid cell type osteosarcoma cells are irregular cells, larger than normal cells, with high nucleoli obvious degree, also tends to be more malignant. The cells of Microvillus adenocarcinomas like osteosarcoma are smaller, similar to microvillus adenocarcinomas in small cell lung cancer, and often have a high degree of malignancy. Blastell-like osteosarcoma is characterized by large, round or oval cells with prominent nuclei and tends to have a low degree of malignancy.
The therapeutic significance of targeting cell cycle proteins in osteosarcoma is to inhibit the growth and spread of the cancer by blocking the cell cycle progression, potentially leading to a decrease in tumor size and improved overall survival outcomes. It has also been shown to sensitize patients to chemotherapy. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanism of action and optimal dosing regimens.
The role of MDM2 in the development of osteosarcoma is still unclear. Further research is necessary to understand its involvement in the disease.
CCNE1 is a key regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation, and it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer. CCNE1 expression is often elevated in osteosarcoma cells, and inhibition of CCNE1 using small molecule inhibitors has been shown to have anti-tumor effects in preclinical models of osteosarcoma. Additionally, CCNE1 has been found to regulate the activity of other genes involved in the development and progression of osteosarcoma.
