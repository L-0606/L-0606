Osteosarcoma is a type of cancer that affects the bones. The main clinical symptoms of osteosarcoma may include:  1. Pain: Osteosarcoma often causes severe pain in the affected bone. This pain may be constant or intermittent and may be worse during activities that put pressure on the affected area. 2. Swelling and tenderness: The affected bone may become swollen and tender to the touch. 3. Limited mobility: Osteosarcoma can cause the affected bone to become weak and fragile, making it difficult to move or perform daily activities. 4. fractures: Fractures may occur in the affected bone as a result of osteosarcoma. 5. Changes in appearance: The affected bone may become misshapen or deformed as a result of osteosarcoma. 6. Numbness or tingling: There may be numbness or tingling sensations in the affected area as a result of osteosarcoma.  It's important to note that not everyone with osteosarcoma will experience all of these symptoms, and some people may experience different symptoms altogether. If you are concerned about any of these symptoms, it's important to speak with a healthcare provider.
Osteosarcoma is a type of cancer that affects the bones, and it can occur in any bone. However, the most common sites of osteosarcoma are the long bones of the legs, such as the femur (thigh bone) and the tibia (shin bone), as well as the spine and the jawbones.  In children, osteosarcoma is most commonly found in the femur, tibia, and fibula (one of the smaller bones of the leg). In adults, it is more likely to be found in the spine or the jawbones.  It's important to note that osteosarcoma can occur in any bone, and the specific site of the cancer can affect the treatment options that are available. If you are concerned about a potential osteosarcoma diagnosis, it's important to speak with a healthcare provider who can evaluate your symptoms and help determine the best course of action.
Osteosarcoma is a type of cancer that affects the bones and can potentially spread to other parts of the body. The incidence of metastasis, or the spread of cancer to other parts of the body, varies depending on the specific type of osteosarcoma and the individual patient.  In general, the incidence of metastasis for osteosarcoma is relatively low, but it can occur. For example, the incidence of metastasis for primary osteosarcoma (cancer that starts in the bone) is estimated to be around 20% for adults, with the most common sites of metastasis being the lung, bone, and soft tissue.  For children, the incidence of metastasis is higher, with the most common sites of metastasis being the lung, bone, and liver.  It's important to note that the incidence of metastasis can vary depending on the specific type of osteosarcoma and the individual patient. If you have been diagnosed with osteosarcoma, it's important to speak with your healthcare provider to discuss the risks and potential consequences of metastasis, as well as the treatment options that are available. 
Preoperative chemotherapy and postoperative chemotherapy are both types of chemotherapy that may be used in the treatment of osteosarcoma.  Preoperative chemotherapy is chemotherapy that is given before surgery (preoperatively) to try to reduce the size of the tumor and make it easier to remove with surgery. This can be done to improve the outcome of the surgery and to reduce the risk of recurrence. Preoperative chemotherapy may be used in cases of osteosarcoma that are not able to be removed with surgery alone or where the cancer has come back after treatment with surgery.  Postoperative chemotherapy is chemotherapy that is given after surgery to try to reduce the risk of recurrence. This type of chemotherapy may be used in cases of osteosarcoma where the cancer has not been completely removed or where the patient has a high risk of recurrence.  It's important to note that the role of preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy in the treatment of osteosarcoma can vary depending on the specific type of cancer and the individual patient. Your healthcare provider can help you understand the potential benefits and risks of these treatments and determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
