## Introduction

This is a single-disease osteosarcoma knowledge graph-based Q&A system incorporating ChatGLM3-6b.

By manually annotating and integrating more than `20,000` articles on osteosarcoma from Pumbed, we established the first knowledge graph for osteosarcoma. We also applied this graph and chatGLM3 to develop a question-answering model. It can overcome the "illusion" of the large model and help researchers find the knowledge they need more easily and accurately.

## A notice on operating system compatibility
- **Python**: We developed this method using python version 3.10.x.
- **CUDA**:  We developed this method using python version 12.0
- **neo4j**:  We developed this method using python version 5.15.0.

## Before installation
We used a computer equipped with an RTX 3090 graphics card for the experiment. For stability and improved computing efficiency, we recommend using a computer with RTX 3090 or above.
## usage
``` bash
# Firstly, run the neo4j database. (localhost:7474) 
  neo4j start
#Secondly, run the ChatGLM3-6b model. (localhost:8000) 
  python openai_api.py 
#Back-end Run 
  python main.py 
```
