Additionally, some studies have suggested that targeting these signaling pathways may lead to the activation of immune response systems, which can further enhance the effectiveness of treatments.
The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays a crucial role in regulating cell survival and proliferation in osteosarcoma cells. It promotes the formation of new blood vessels, which can contribute to the metastatic spread of osteosarcoma. Additionally, the PI3K/Akt pathway regulates the activity of immune cells and can affect their function in combating osteosarcoma metastasis.
The role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in osteosarcoma metastasis is to promote the migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells by modulating cell signaling pathways associated with cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.

The role of 12q13-15 region amplification in osteosarcoma is to promote tumor growth and survival, influence cell behavior, and affect treatment outcomes.
The IDH mutation is associated with a higher risk of developing osteosarcoma, whereas its significance in chondrosarcoma is not as clear.
The significance of FOS and USP6 genes in the differential diagnosis of osteosarcoma is that they can provide valuable information for identifying patients who are more likely to develop this disease and for predicting the severity of osteosarcoma. Additionally, understanding the role of these genes can also help with developing new treatments for osteosarcoma.
The VEGF/VEGFR pathway plays a crucial role in osteosarcoma development and progression by regulating blood vessel growth and angiogenesis.
The role of PDGF/PDGFR pathway in osteosarcoma is associated with cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Abnormalities in this pathway have been observed in osteosarcoma, which leads to increased cell proliferation and potential therapeutic targets.
